Seriously Matt was created to juxtapose my natural serious demeanor with the eccentric and mundane musings of the trivial. I wanted to be able to share about the serious topics that pique my interest. And I wanted to write how my viewpoints on fruit are highly dependent on their seed size relative to my teeth. My theme encompasses my interests which change by the year, month, or week. 

Another major reason for this website is the IndieWeb where people own and maintain their content. I generate content on my site, and share it on other platforms. There are links on this tab to verify my account across sites. 

I don't have comments enabled, but if someone finds one of my posts interesting, let me know in one of the social media links provided. Please forgive all spelling and grammatical mistakes.
